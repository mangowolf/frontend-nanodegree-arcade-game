##How to load and play the game:

1a. Go to [Frogger Clone](http://mangowolf.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/)

or

1b. If running the file locally, be sure to have the css, images, js, and index.html files in a single folder on your local drive. Then run the index.html file in your preferred browser.

2. Move the character found on the bottom of the screen across the stone tiles while avoiding the enemy bugs moving horizontally across the screen. Players can move their character across the screen using the arrow keys. Players win when the character is safely moved to the water tiles at the top of the screen.
